# üõçÔ∏è E-Commerce System

A simple C# based e-commerce system that simulates real-world product management, shopping cart functionality, checkout process, and shipping service.

## üì¶ Features

### üõí Product Management
- Define products with:
  - `name`
  - `price`
  - `quantity`
- Supports **perishable products** (e.g. Cheese, Biscuits) that can expire.
- Supports **non-perishable products** (e.g. TV, Mobile).
- Products may or may not be **shippable**:
  - Shippable products (e.g. Cheese, TV) must provide a `weight`.
  - Non-shippable products (e.g. Mobile recharge cards) do not require shipping.

### üßç Customer Interaction
- Customers can:
  - Add products to their cart with a desired quantity (must not exceed stock).
  - Checkout items in their cart.

### üí≥ Checkout Process
- During checkout, the system:
  - Prints order details to the console:
    - Subtotal (sum of item prices √ó quantity)
    - Shipping fees
    - Total paid amount (subtotal + shipping fees)
    - Customer‚Äôs remaining balance
- Validates and handles errors:
  - ‚ùå Cart is empty
  - ‚ùå Customer balance is insufficient
  - ‚ùå Product is out of stock or expired
